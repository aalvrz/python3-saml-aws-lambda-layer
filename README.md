# ðŸ“¦ python3-saml-aws-lambda-layer

This repository contains a ready-to-use [AWS Lambda layer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-layers.html) for using the [python3-saml](https://github.com/onelogin/python3-saml) package in a Python 3.8 runtime.

All Python packages have been built and compiled in an Amazon AMI system.

You can browse the contents of the layer or simply get the layer ZIP file from the [Releases](https://github.com/aalvrz/python3-saml-aws-lambda-layer/releases) section.
